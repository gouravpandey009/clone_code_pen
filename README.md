# CodePen Clone

A CodePen clone is a web application that replicates the functionality of the popular online code editor CodePen. It provides users with a platform to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a browser-based code editor, see the live output in real-time, and share their creations with others.

## Features

1. **Code Editor**: User-friendly interface for writing and editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code with syntax highlighting and auto-completion features.

2. **Live Preview**: Real-time display of the output of the code, allowing users to see how their changes affect the appearance and behavior of the webpage.

3. **Code Sharing**: Ability to share code snippets or projects with others by generating a unique URL or embedding the code in websites or blogs.

4. **Community Interaction**: Users can discover, explore, and interact with projects created by other users, such as liking, commenting, and forking (creating a copy) of projects.

5. **User Accounts**: Provides user registration and authentication features to save and manage personal projects, access advanced features, and participate in the community.

6. **Additional Features**: May include features such as version control, collaboration tools, templates, code libraries, and educational resources to enhance the user experience and productivity.
